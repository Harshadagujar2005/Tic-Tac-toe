Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. This repository contains a Python program that allows two players (or player vs AI, if implemented) to play the classic 3x3 grid game.

🎮 Description

The Tic Tac Toe project is a console-based (or GUI, depending on your version) game where:

Two players take turns marking spaces with X and O.

The first player to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

If all nine squares are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.

✨ Features

3x3 grid implementation

Player vs Player mode

Optionally: AI opponent (using simple logic or minimax algorithm)

Win/draw detection

Clear and interactive display of the board

⚙️ How to Run

📘 Requirements

Python 3.x

(If you use AI or GUI, add extra dependencies like pygame here in a requirements.txt.)

🚀 Possible Improvements

Add AI opponent with minimax algorithm

Add GUI using pygame or Tkinter

Allow score tracking across multiple rounds
